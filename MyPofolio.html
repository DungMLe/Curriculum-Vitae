				<h3 id = "intro"><li>Introduction:</li></h3>
					<p>My name is Dung Manh Le, and I am from Vietnam. I came to the United States to
					study engineering, and I have honor to receive my first degree, Computer Engineering
					Technology, at <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Tennessee_Community_CollegeSouthwest > 
					Southwest Tenn Community College </a> in 2016. After my graduation, I decided to pursue
					higer education at the University of Memphis. I started my first year as an junior in 
					Engineer Department and studied duel majors, Computer and Electrical Engineering; however
					after a course of computer engineering field, Introduction to Java Programming, I found 
					out my passion for programming and software development. For that reason, I switched
					my major to Computer Science and now concentrating into Cyber Security.</p>
