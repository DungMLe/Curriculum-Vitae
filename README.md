				My name is Dung Manh Le, and I am from Vietnam. I came to the United States to

					study engineering, and I have honor to receive my first degree, <b>Computer Engineering Technology</b>

					, at <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Tennessee_Community_CollegeSouthwest > 

					Southwest Tenn Community College </a> in 2016. After my graduation, I decided to pursue

					higer education at the University of Memphis. I started my first year as an junior in 

					Engineer Department and studied duel majors, <b>Computer and Electrical Engineering</b>; however

					after a course of computer engineering field, Introduction to Java Programming, I found 

					out my passion for programming and software development. For that reason, I switched

					my major to <b>Computer Science</b> and now concentrating into <b>Cyber Security</b>.
